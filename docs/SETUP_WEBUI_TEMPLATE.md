1. Fork the repository and clone your forked version locally.
2. Go to the directory of the project: `cd webui-workshop`
4. Install the project dependencies via: `npm ci`. More dependencies will be installed during the exercises
5. Copy the configuration file: `cp config-default.js config.js`
6. Run: `node index.js`
