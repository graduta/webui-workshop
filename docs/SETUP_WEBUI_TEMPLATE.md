1. Clone the repository via HTTPS/SSH (https://github.com/graduta/webui-workshop)
2. Go to the directory of the project: `cd webui-workshop`
3. Create your own branch: `git checkout -b <your-username/branch-name>`
4. Install the project dependencies via: `npm ci`. More dependencies will be installed during the exercises
5. Copy the configuration file: `cp config-default.js config.js`
